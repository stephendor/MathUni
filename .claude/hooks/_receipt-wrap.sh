# _receipt-wrap.sh: transparent wrapper around a harness hook that appends a
# durable one-line execution receipt (timestamp, hook name, decision, target
# file) to .claude/hooks/hook-receipts.log on every invocation, then re-emits
# the wrapped hook's stdout unchanged. Never alters the wrapped hook's decision
# and never blocks on a logging failure.
#
# Ported unchanged in behaviour from TDL's .claude/hooks/_receipt-wrap.sh (812cc0f9);
# only this comment names MathUni's hook instead of TDL's six.
#
# Why (obs 121, 122, 125): PreToolUse hooks had no durable execution signal, so
# a silent fail-open (e.g. a cold-start subprocess-spawn racing the hook's own
# timeout — obs 125, empirically observed on a fresh session's first hook
# invocation) left no trace distinguishing "nothing to deny" from "the check
# never ran." This wrapper makes every invocation — including a fail-open —
# visible after the fact via one grep-able log line, without touching the
# wrapped hook's own decision logic. Wraps MathUni's PreToolUse hook
# (commit-state-guard), which prints a "FAILING OPEN (reason)" line to stderr on
# its own internal fallback path.
#
# Advisory mode (obs 2026-09-08-posttooluse-hooks-lack-receipt-wrap): a
# PostToolUse hook (here the commit-state-guard branch recorder) wired into
# settings.json unwrapped has zero receipts — indistinguishable from never
# having run. It cannot be wrapped in the default strict mode because it emits
# no permissionDecision JSON, so strict parsing would stamp every single
# invocation FAILOPEN(no-decision-in-output) and the receipt would carry no
# information. `--advisory` classifies on what an advisory hook actually
# signals instead: `advise` (it ran and had something to warn about) vs
# `silent` (it ran and matched nothing). Both are positive proof of execution,
# which is the whole point of the receipt for an always-exit-0 hook.
#
# Usage (from settings.json): _receipt-wrap.sh [--advisory] <hook-script-path>
# The wrapped hook still reads the tool-call JSON from stdin as normal.
#
# Mis-wiring control: when the harness payload carries `hook_event_name`, the
# mode flag is cross-checked against it and a mismatch is recorded as
# MISWIRED(<event>) rather than a decision — the flag is static wiring, so a
# strict-wrapped PostToolUse hook (or an advisory-wrapped PreToolUse gate, the
# strictly worse direction) leaves a durable trace instead of quietly
# mis-classifying every receipt it writes. The field is treated as optional:
# absent, the flag alone selects the mode.
#
# Run `bash _receipt-wrap.sh --selftest` to exercise the sanitizer negative
# controls (obs 2026-08-02-hook-receipts-log-content-injection).
